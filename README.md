Intelli Snake
Intelli Snake is an interactive and modern version of the classic snake game, utilizing real-time hand tracking with OpenCV and the cvzone library. In this project, players control the snake's movement using their hand gestures detected through a webcam. The game challenges players to collect food items to grow the snake while avoiding collisions.

Features
Real-Time Hand Tracking: Uses OpenCV and cvzone's HandTrackingModule to detect and track hand movements.

Dynamic Gameplay: The snake grows longer as it eats food, increasing the game's difficulty.

Score Tracking: Displays the current score and the game over message when the snake collides with itself.

Interactive UI: Real-time feedback and smooth graphics using OpenCV.
